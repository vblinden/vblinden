          <p>
            Yesterday I had a really difficult time with pulling in a submodule from an old git repository I had laying
            around. I thought a quick <strike>Google</strike> DuckDuckGo search would solve all my problems, but alas.
            There was a lot of outdated information that simply didnâ€™t work with the Git version I had installed on my
            computer (or I applied incorrectly).
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally I found an{' '}

              answer
            </a>{' '}
            on StackOverflow that quite work, but send me in the right direction. Eventually I gave up and did what I
            should have done in the first place: Look at the{' '}
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              Git documentation
            </a>{' '}
            for the submodule command.
          </p>

          <p>The command I ran (from the root of my git folder) that worked for me after I cloned my repository was:</p>

          <Highlight className="bash">{'git submodule update --init --recursive'}</Highlight>

          <p>Lesson learned: If there is documentation available, consult that first.</p>
