            Unfortunately DigitalOcean had a node failure yesterday in their AMS3 data center. And sadly my virtual
            machine running my blog was on there and I didnâ€™t have backups enabled. So all my data is permanently gone.
            Which is not a huge problem, because I only had two small blog posts on here. So today I decided to make my
            blog a static website using{' '}
            <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              Next.js
            </a>
            .
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Post>
  );
};

export default NeverForgetBackups;
