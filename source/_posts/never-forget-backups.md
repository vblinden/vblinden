Unfortunately DigitalOcean had a node failure yesterday in their AMS3 data center. And sadly my virtual machine running
my blog was on there and I didn’t have backups enabled. So all my data is permanently gone. Which is not a huge problem,
because I only had two small blog posts on here. So today I decided to make my blog a static website
using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.com/).
