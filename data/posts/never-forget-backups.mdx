Unfortunately DigitalOcean had a node failure yesterday in their AMS3 data center. And sadly my virtual machine running my blog was on there and I didnâ€™t have backups enabled. So all my data is permanently gone. Which is not a huge problem, because I only had two small blog posts on here. So today I decided to make my blog a static website using <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.js</a>.
