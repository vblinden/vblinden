        Unfortunately DigitalOcean had a node failure yesterday in their AMS3 data center. And sadly my virtual machine
        running my blog was on there and I didnâ€™t have backups enabled. So all my data is permanently gone. Which is not
        a huge problem, because I only had two small blog posts on here. So today I decided to make my blog a static
        website using{' '}
        <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">
          Next.js
        </a>
        .
      </p>
    </Post>
  );
};

export default NeverForgetBackups;
